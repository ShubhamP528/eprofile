# Design Document

## Overview

This design implements a comprehensive loading screen system with a centralized, reusable loading component that provides consistent visual feedback across the entire application. The solution includes multiple loading variants, customizable messages, and seamless integration with existing components.

## Architecture

The loading system follows a component-based architecture:

1. **Core Loading Component**: Base loading component with configurable variants
2. **Loading Variants**: Different loading types (full-screen, inline, button, card)
3. **Integration Layer**: Easy integration with existing components and pages
4. **Styling System**: Consistent design using Tailwind CSS classes

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Loading Component

**File**: `components/ui/loading.tsx`

```typescript
interface LoadingProps {
  variant?: "fullscreen" | "inline" | "button" | "card" | "spinner";
  size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg" | "xl";
  message?: string;
  className?: string;
  showMessage?: boolean;
}
```

### Loading Variants

1. **Full Screen Loading**

   - Covers entire viewport
   - Used for page transitions and initial loading
   - Includes brand logo and loading message

2. **Inline Loading**

   - Fits within content areas
   - Used for component-level loading states
   - Maintains layout structure

3. **Button Loading**

   - Small spinner for button states
   - Replaces button content during actions
   - Maintains button dimensions

4. **Card Loading**

   - Skeleton loading for card components
   - Maintains card structure while loading
   - Used in lists and grids

5. **Spinner Only**
   - Simple spinner without additional elements
   - Used for minimal loading indicators

### Design Specifications

#### Visual Design

- **Primary Color**: Blue (#3B82F6) for spinner and accents
- **Background**: Semi-transparent overlay for full-screen variant
- **Animation**: Smooth 1-second rotation for spinner
- **Typography**: Consistent with application font stack
- **Spacing**: Responsive padding and margins

#### Responsive Behavior

- **Mobile**: Optimized touch-friendly sizing
- **Tablet**: Balanced proportions for medium screens
- **Desktop**: Full-featured display with larger elements

#### Accessibility

- **ARIA Labels**: Proper loading announcements for screen readers
- **Focus Management**: Appropriate focus handling during loading
- **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG guidelines for visibility
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user motion preferences

## Data Models

No data model changes required. This is purely a UI component enhancement.

## Error Handling

- Graceful fallback for animation failures
- Timeout handling for long-running operations
- Error state transitions from loading states
- Proper cleanup of loading states

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing

- Unit tests for all loading variants
- Props validation and default behavior
- Animation and timing tests
- Accessibility compliance tests

### Integration Testing

- Loading state transitions in real components
- Performance impact assessment
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile device testing

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Loading Component

- Create base loading component with all variants
- Implement responsive design and accessibility features
- Add TypeScript interfaces and documentation

### Phase 2: Component Integration

- Replace existing loading implementations across the application
- Update dashboard layout, auth pages, and card components
- Integrate with form submissions and API calls

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Add skeleton loading for complex components
- Implement loading state management utilities
- Add animation customization options

## Design Decisions

1. **Single Component Approach**: Using one component with variants reduces bundle size and ensures consistency

2. **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Leveraging existing design system for consistent styling and responsive behavior

3. **Accessibility First**: Built-in ARIA support and screen reader compatibility from the start

4. **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight animations and efficient rendering to minimize impact on application performance

5. **Flexible Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing components without major refactoring

6. **Brand Consistency**: Incorporates application branding elements (logo, colors) in appropriate variants

## Current Loading Implementations to Replace

Based on the codebase analysis, the following loading implementations will be standardized:

1. **Dashboard Layout**: Session loading spinner
2. **Feature Gate**: Skeleton loading for restricted features
3. **Subscription Badge**: Loading state handling
4. **Auth Pages**: Form submission loading states
5. **Card Components**: Data fetching loading states
6. **API Calls**: Request/response loading indicators

## Animation Specifications

- **Spinner Animation**: 360-degree rotation over 1 second, infinite loop
- **Fade In/Out**: 200ms transition for smooth appearance/disappearance
- **Skeleton Pulse**: Subtle opacity animation for skeleton elements
- **Reduced Motion**: Static indicators for users with motion sensitivity preferences
