# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a standardized loading screen component that provides consistent visual feedback across the entire eProfile platform, replacing various loading implementations with a unified design and behavior.

## Glossary

- **Loading Screen**: A visual component displayed while content is being fetched or processed
- **Loading Component**: A reusable React component that displays loading state
- **Loading State**: The period when data is being fetched or an operation is in progress
- **Spinner**: An animated visual element indicating loading activity
