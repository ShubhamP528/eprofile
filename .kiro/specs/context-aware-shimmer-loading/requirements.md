# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the loading experience by providing context-aware shimmer effects that mimic the structure and layout of the content being loaded, creating a more intuitive and polished user experience during data fetching operations.

## Glossary

- **Shimmer_System**: The loading component system that displays animated placeholder content
- **Context_Aware_Loading**: Loading states that match the structure of the expected content
- **Skeleton_Component**: Individual UI elements that represent placeholders for specific content types
- **Loading_Variant**: Different shimmer patterns for different UI contexts (cards, lists, forms, etc.)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see structured loading placeholders that match the layout I'm expecting, so that I have a clear understanding of what content is being loaded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is loading, THE Shimmer_System SHALL display placeholder elements that match the expected content structure
2. THE Shimmer_System SHALL provide animated shimmer effects across all placeholder elements
3. THE Shimmer_System SHALL maintain consistent spacing and proportions with the actual content
4. THE Shimmer_System SHALL support multiple layout variants for different content types
5. THE Shimmer_System SHALL seamlessly transition from loading state to actual content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable shimmer components for different UI patterns, so that I can easily implement consistent loading states across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Shimmer_System SHALL provide card-based loading skeletons for dashboard cards
2. THE Shimmer_System SHALL provide list-based loading skeletons for data tables and lists
3. THE Shimmer_System SHALL provide form-based loading skeletons for input forms
4. THE Shimmer_System SHALL provide profile-based loading skeletons for user profile sections
5. THE Shimmer_System SHALL allow customization of skeleton dimensions and layout

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want loading states that feel responsive and engaging, so that waiting times feel shorter and the interface feels more polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Shimmer_System SHALL use smooth animation timing that feels natural
2. THE Shimmer_System SHALL provide visual feedback that indicates active loading
3. THE Shimmer_System SHALL maintain visual hierarchy similar to actual content
4. THE Shimmer_System SHALL use appropriate color schemes that match the application theme
5. THE Shimmer_System SHALL be accessible and not cause visual discomfort

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily integrate context-aware loading states, so that I can replace generic loading indicators with structured placeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Shimmer_System SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing loading patterns
2. THE Shimmer_System SHALL provide simple props-based configuration
3. THE Shimmer_System SHALL support conditional rendering based on loading states
4. THE Shimmer_System SHALL maintain performance during animations
5. THE Shimmer_System SHALL work consistently across different screen sizes
