# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical database connection issues occurring in production deployment on Vercel. The system is experiencing PrismaClientInitializationError due to invalid database URL strings, preventing authentication and API operations from functioning properly in production while working correctly in local development.

## Glossary

- **Database_Connection_System**: The Prisma client configuration and connection management system
- **Environment_Configuration_System**: The system that manages environment variables across different deployment environments
- **Production_Environment**: The live Vercel deployment environment where the application serves real users
- **Database_URL_Validator**: Component that validates and sanitizes database connection strings
- **Connection_Pool_Manager**: System that manages database connection pooling for production environments

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database connection to work reliably in production, so that users can authenticate and access all application features without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts in production, THE Database_Connection_System SHALL establish a valid connection to the PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN a user attempts to authenticate via Google OAuth, THE Database_Connection_System SHALL successfully execute database queries without throwing PrismaClientInitializationError
3. WHEN API endpoints are called in production, THE Database_Connection_System SHALL handle database operations without connection string validation errors
4. WHERE the application is deployed on Vercel, THE Database_Connection_System SHALL properly configure connection pooling parameters
5. IF a database connection fails, THEN THE Database_Connection_System SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment variable validation and configuration, so that database connection issues are caught early and resolved systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are loaded, THE Environment_Configuration_System SHALL validate the DATABASE_URL format before initializing Prisma
2. WHEN special characters exist in the database URL, THE Database_URL_Validator SHALL properly escape or encode them
3. WHILE the application runs in production, THE Environment_Configuration_System SHALL ensure all required database connection parameters are present
4. WHERE connection pooling is required, THE Connection_Pool_Manager SHALL append appropriate query parameters to the database URL
5. IF environment variables are missing or invalid, THEN THE Environment_Configuration_System SHALL prevent application startup with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want robust database connection handling across different environments, so that deployments are reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments, THE Database_Connection_System SHALL adapt connection parameters based on the environment type
2. WHEN connection limits are reached, THE Connection_Pool_Manager SHALL handle connection pooling gracefully
3. WHILE running in production, THE Database_Connection_System SHALL implement appropriate timeout and retry mechanisms
4. WHERE SSL connections are required, THE Database_Connection_System SHALL configure SSL parameters correctly
5. IF database connectivity issues occur, THEN THE Database_Connection_System SHALL log detailed connection attempt information for troubleshooting
