# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature updates all dialog boxes, modals, overlays, and similar components throughout the eProfile platform to use transparent backgrounds with blur effects instead of solid black backgrounds, creating a more modern and visually appealing user interface.

## Glossary

- **Dialog Box**: A modal window that appears over the main content to display information or collect user input
- **Modal Overlay**: The background layer behind dialog boxes that covers the main content
- **Backdrop Blur**: A CSS effect that applies a blur filter to content behind an overlay
- **Transparency**: Semi-transparent background that allows underlying content to show through
- **Overlay Component**: Any UI element that appears on top of the main content (modals, dropdowns, tooltips, etc.)
